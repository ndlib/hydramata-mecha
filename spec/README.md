Congratulations, you are reading the README of the specs.

Why is this here? Because specs are an important subject.

One of my development foci for Hydramata::Mecha has been a focus on keeping the test suite's runtime healthy. Yes, each spec that I write adds time to the test suite, but I want that to be a linear growth.

In this directory you will find several files with filename pattern `spec_*_helper.rb`.
As I've worked through specs, my goal has been to use the fastest spec helper
possible.
This typically means striving to use the `spec_fast_helper.rb`, but acknowledging that may not be feasible.
